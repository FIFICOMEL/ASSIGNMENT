        <h2>About the Assignment</h2>
         <p>This assignment serves as a comprehensive exploration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the context of web design. The goal is to design a mini-website titled "Conversion Calculator." The site is structured into three main pages:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Homepage:</strong> A warm welcome and introduction to both myself and the purpose of the website.</li>
            <li><strong>Conversion Page:</strong> Information about the chosen conversion process, such as currency, measurement, or character conversion.</li>
            <li><strong>Conversion Calculator:</strong> A practical page where visitors can perform actual calculations based on the chosen conversion process using JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I've employed my creativity to ensure an engaging user experience, and the Cascading Style Sheet (.css) file provides consistent styling across all pages. The JavaScript functionality enhances interactivity, allowing users to actively participate in the conversion process.</p>
